A todo list that can be added to and deleted from as well as crossed out.

## Deployed Application
[Click here to go to the deployed app!](https://cwedwards9.github.io/todo-list-jquery/)

## Description
This todo list allows the user to input tasks and save them to a list when they press 'enter'. When tasks are added to the list, they are saved to the user's local storage so they can remain in the list when the user clicks out of the application and accesses it later. The tasks can be crossed off when clicked on or deleted if the user hovers over the task and clicks the trash can icon next to the task. When a task is deleted, it is removed from the list and from local storage.
